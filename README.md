# fibonacci

Included are two different functions that both return an array of fibonacci sequenced numbers. The parameter for both is the number of places you wish to sequence. The fibs function utilizes a loop to accomplish this. The other function (fibsRec), recursively accomplishes this task.

Ex: A call of fibs(8) or fibsRec(8) would return [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13]
